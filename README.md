Quick notes for this theme

Figure out how to use pagination when the posts are accumulated.

It's suggested that post name shouldn't be too long (the url should be 50 characters at most), otherwise it's not able to create comment for the long name post.

Usage of glyphicon in the theme:
- Tips: glyphicon-star
- Information: glyphicon-info-sign
- Cloud: glyphicon-cloud
- Shared: glyphicon-bookmark
- Bio: glyphicon-pencil
- Book: glyphicon-book

Since Bootstrap 4 doesn't support _glyphicon_, add _Font Awesome_ instead

Usage of fontawesome in the theme:
- Tips: fa-laptop
- Information: fa-info-circle
- Code: fa-code
- Cloud: fa-cloud
- Shared: fa-bookmark
- Bio: fa-pencil-alt
- Book: fa-bookmark

add <link href="/bootstrap-4.0.0-dist/fontawesome-free-5.0.6/web-fonts-with-css/css/fontawesome.css" rel="stylesheet">
and <script src="/bootstrap-4.0.0-dist/fontawesome-free-5.0.6/on-server/js/fontawesome-all.js"></script>
